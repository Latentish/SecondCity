Their high levels of Rage put them on the edge at all times - the Full Moon's blessing is a hair trigger, among other things. Those closer to the waxing moon tend to exult in the glory of the war, while those closer to the waning moon are more viciously pragmatic, ruthless in their bloodthirst. Every Ahroun is a dangerous individual to be around, but when the forces of the Wyrm attack, their packmates are glad to have a Full Moon warrior at the front of the charge."

While all Galliards are prone to immense mirth and immense melancholy, those born under a waning moon fall more readily into dark, consuming passions; they are the tragedians of the Garou, mastering tales of doom, ruin, sacrifice and loss. Conversely, their waxing-moon cousins sing of triumph and conquest, of the pounding heart and the love of life. They tend to be the soul of their pack's morale - when the Galliard is willing to go on, so too are all the others."
